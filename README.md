## Adding a New Layer

A layer consists of, as minimum:

* `README.md` describing the layer (configuration, keybindings etc)
* `config.vim` adding the layer key bindings
* `packages.vim` adding the packages that needs to be installed

These files are grouped under a `+category/layer-name` directory hierachy. As an example, the layer `buffers` is located under the group `+nav` (short for navigation).

In the `config.vim` and `packages.vim` you want to check if the layer is enabled, before doing anything. This can be done with,

```viml
if SpaceNeovimIsLayerEnabled('+checkers/syntax-checking')
  " Configuration/Package setup goes here...
endif
```

### Add a Keybinding

To add a keybinding, first make sure that the vim-leader-guide grouping exists with

```viml
let g:lmap.e = { 'name': '+syntax-checking' }
```

__NOTE:__ if you are adding a new language, you don't have to add the grouping, since `let g:lmap.m = { 'name': '+major-mode-cmd' }` already exists.

The `e` in `g:lmap.e` denotes the key that the group is under. Then add your keybinding by using `SpaceNeovimBind` or the shorter `SpaceNeovimNMap`/`SpaceNeovimMap`,

```viml
call SpaceNeovimBind('map', 'el', 'lint-file', 'Neomake!', 1)
" Is equivalent to
SpaceNeovimMap('el', 'lint-file', 'Neomake!')

call SpaceNeovimBind('nmap', 'el', 'lint-file', 'Neomake!', 0)
" Is equivalent to
SpaceNeovimNMap('el', 'lint-file', 'Neomake!', 0)
```

which puts the keybinding at `SPC e l`. Note that the first `e` in `el` is necessary to put it under the `e` grouping.

For more check out the `+nav/buffers` layer for an example of usage, and `bindings.vim` for the helper functions.

### Adding Packages

This time we use `SpaceNeovimAddPlugin` to add the plugin and its vim-plug configuration,

```viml
call SpaceNeovimAddPlugin('neomake/neomake', {})
```

which will add the package 'neomake/neomake' to be installed with the configuration `{}`. The configuration can be used for post-installation commands or to lazy-load the plugin (e.g. only loading a language plugin when that language filetype is active).

### Including Files

To keep the files a bit more clean, your functions should reside in separate files, such as `func.vim`. To easily include them use

```viml
" Load `func.vim` in the current layer directory
call SpaceNeovimLoadFunc(expand('<sfile>:p'))

" Load `other-file.vim` in current layer directory
call SpaceNeovimLoadFunc(expand('<sfile>:p'), 'other-file.vim')
```

The `expand('<sfile>:p')` bit is to include the path of the current layer that is calling the `SpaceNeovimLoadFunc` function. If no second argument is given it defaults to `func.vim`, since that is the normal convention.

For more check out the `+nav/files` layer for an example of usage, and `helpers.vim` for the helper functions.

## Adding a New Language Layer

Most of adding a new language layer is just like adding a normal layer, except for keybindings, as described below.

### Add a language keybinding

Adding a language keybinding is a bit different, since we only want it shown when the language is actually active. All language keybindings should be under `SPC m`, and if you use the helper functions, that's also where they'll go.

It consist of three steps:

1. Add your groupings
1. Add your mappings
1. Add clean up autocmd

__Step 1.__ is done using `SpaceNeovimFileTypeGroup`, for example to add the group `SPC m d` when using `haskell`,

```viml
call SpaceNeovimFileTypeGroup('haskell', 'd', 'haskell/documentation')
```

No need to specify `m` since that is assumed.

Going to __step 2.__, you either use the longer `SpaceNeovimFTBind` or the wrappers `SpaceNeovimFTNMap`/`SpaceNeovimFTMap` depending on what you want, as such,

```viml
call SpaceNeovimFTNMap('haskell', 'mdh', 'search-hoogle', 'call feedkeys(":Hoogle ")')
```

Finally for __step 3.__, we call `SpaceNeovimCleanupFileTypeGroups` as such,

```viml
call SpaceNeovimCleanupFileTypeGroups('haskell')
```

Which will clear the mappings upon leaving the buffer (`BufLeave`).

For more check out the `+lang/haskell` layer for an example of usage, and `bindings.vim` for the helper functions.
